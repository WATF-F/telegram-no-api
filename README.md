## 🚀 How It Works  

1. **Run the program** and log in to Telegram.  
2. **Open the target Telegram channel** and scroll down to the latest message.  
3. The program **waits for new messages** and analyzes them based on the patterns defined in the `patterns` file.  
4. When a **new trading signal** arrives, the bot automatically **places an order on Bybit**.  

## ⚠ Important
